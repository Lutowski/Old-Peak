ᛦ DO IT TWICE, OR IT'S LUCK.
ᛦ Curse this. My ears are burning. Hell. Hell. Hell. Hell. HELL.
ᛦ PIG-SHIT SMELLS AND THE MAGGOTS FESTER.
ᛦ LORD, WHERE ART THOU?
ᛦ Flies to a honey strip. Flies to a honey strip.
ᛦ Overdose me on Ozium and let my body scream you its last.
IT'S EATING ME. THE TUMOR IS EATING ME. MY HEAD. MY HEAD!!
ᛦ They want me dead.
ᛦ Parts of the world are crumbling. What is this? What is this?!
ᛦ THE COLLAPSE, THE ROT, THE INJUSTICE; INTERTWINED CANCER, INCURABLE.
ᛦ Millions will die. It will be my fault. I should have done more.
ᛦ Millions will die. It will be my fault. I should kill more.
ᛦ PRAY. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.
ᛦ ZIZO. ZIZO. ZIZO. ZIZO. ZIZO. ZIZO. ZIZO.
ᛦ FIVE POWDER CHARGES; I LOAD THEM IN AN UNKNOWN ORDER.
ᛦ CROSSBOW TO MY MOUTH. PULL THE TRIGGER.
ᛦ I AM SURROUNDED BY PUTREFACTION
ᛦ Twice or it was just luck. Twice or it was just luck.
ᛦ I AM MAKING IT WORSE, AND FOR THIS I AM POWERFUL
ᛦ DAMN IT ALL.
ᛦ HELLFIRE
I am hit in the head with a bolt! Blood sprays from my head!
Something in my back hurts.
Something in my chest hurts.
Something in my head hurts.
Something in my back hurts.
Something in my chest hurts.
Something in my head hurts.
ᛦ Adrenaline surge. My chest hurts. My breath quickens. Thick smell of death in the air.
ᛦ NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO!
ᛦ Futility. The mind is a prison; evil spirits nestle into it and make it their home.
ᛦ I get it, now. I understand.
ᛦ Mass existence is the cause of my problems.
ᛦ I'm so tired.
ᛦ DON'T LOOK!!
